# Rustle

The Svelte compiler, rewritten in Rust.

## Description

This projects aims to make `Svelte` usable without `Node.js` and make the compiler _blazingly fast_.

## Work in progress
This is still a big work in progress. Only a few parts of Svelte are working now and the CLI tool still needs some work.

## Pre-release roadmap
The only thing I would add before a 0.0.1 prerelease is a simple CLI tool.
